Hi there!

My name is Nikolay Semyachkin.

Currenty working as a software tester and studying Data Science and Machine Learning.

This is going to be a place for me to post about some things I find interesting.

Don't have a lot to show you yet, though.

Pls take this [cute cat picture](http://imgur.com/GVbuz87) as an excuse
